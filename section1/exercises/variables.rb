# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
puts name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
d_says = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts d_says

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22

p students + 2

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:

p students - 2


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Jacq"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 0

puts "Is #{first_name} hungry?"
puts is_hungry
puts "#{first_name} has #{number_of_pets} pets."


# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain.

# Decided to use a string for first_name because it would be easiest to print that way
# Decided to use a boolean for is_hungry because it is describing a true/false state of being
# Decided to use an integer for number_of_pets because it has number in the name of the variable




# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Jude"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 1

puts "My name used to be #{first_name}."
puts "I used to have #{number_of_pets} pet."
puts "He was a cat named Tootsie Roll. It's #{is_hungry} that he was always hungry."

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "The total number of snacks is #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}."
#-------------------
# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?

  # Yes I did.
