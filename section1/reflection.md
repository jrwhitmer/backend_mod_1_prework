## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The parts of the article I resonated the most with where when it talked about learning as a journey, and maintaining a growth mindset. I think it is important to the learning process to want to be learning, dedicating yourself to it, and cultivating habits and attitudes that help you achieve your learning goals. I think I do most of these things fairly well, I was reading and eating blueberries during my last break! I do think I could stand to get more involved socially with learning and teaching others though.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

By putting `p "Hello World!"` or `puts "Hello World!"` or `print "Hello World!"`.

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

`#`

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

An integer is a whole number, a floating number has a decimal; even if it is 1.0, it is a floating number because of the decimal.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`

`x = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

`puts x`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal.`

Interpolation is making the computer run a section of code within a string before printing the string. So if you needed to do some math or print the value of a variable, you could do so within a string.

`puts "This is my sentence with #{x} in it."`

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

The `gets` or `gets.chomp` method can be used to get input from a user.

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

`.length` is a string method that prints how many characters long a string is.
`.split` is a string method that separates words within a string and lists them. The default argument is by spaces, but you can split the string between any chosen character.
