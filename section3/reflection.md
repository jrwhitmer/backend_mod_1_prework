## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- I had never heard the acronym S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time Bound) in terms of setting goals and I'm totally going to use that in my planning for lessons and projects and such.

- I also really liked in the video interview the bit about putting distance between the thing you're struggling with and you as a person. I think it is important to come at a deficit in skills with an optimistic, can-do attitude and putting effort into squashing defeatist thoughts is a good way to help achieve that mindset.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- I think I am good at taking challenges as an opportunity to grow my skill and understanding, rather than feeling too much is being asked of me. However I think I could stand to do better at the planning aspects and setting goals in a mindful way to help me achieve growth.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
_A hash is a way of storing associated data. You have keys and their associated values stored in an unordered list in a hash, but for an array you have a list of data that is indexed by the order it is listed. In an array, the only associated data with each list object is its index number, in an hash, the associated value could be any data type.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

`
pet_store = {'Squeaky toys' => 7, 'treats' => 45, 'crates' => 8}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

`states[IA]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

`states.keys
states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

A hash could be used for storing data about employee clock ins. The keys being the employee's name and the values being the time they clocked in. A Hash would be better to use than an array in this case because a hash can store both sets of data, names and times, and an array could only store one or the other.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
None yet, though I am sure I will have some when I start using them more.
